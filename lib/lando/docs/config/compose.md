# Compose

This service is a "catch all" that allows power users to specify custom services that are not currently one of Lando's [supported services](./../config/services.md). You can easily add it to your Lando app by adding an entry to the [services](./../config/services.md) top-level config in your [Landofile](./../config/lando.md).

Technically speaking, this service is just a way for a user to define a service directly using the [Docker Compose V3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) file format.

**THIS MEANS THAT IT IS UP TO THE USER TO DEFINE A SERVICE CORRECTLY**.

This service is useful if you are:

1. Thinking about contributing your own custom Lando service and just want to prototype something
2. Using Docker Compose config from other projects
3. Need a service not currently provided by Lando itself

## Configuration

Unlike other services, `compose` does not require a `version`, instead it allows you to directly configure Docker Compose's top-level `volumes`, `networks`, and `services` config directly.

::: tip We highly recommend you check the Docker Compose docs!
`services`, `volumes` and `networks` below come directly from Docker Compose so we *highly recommend* you check out their [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/).
:::

```yaml
services:
  custom-service:
    type: compose
    services:
      image: drupal:8
      # Required. See Below
      command: docker-php-entrypoint apache2-foreground
      ports:
        - '80'
    volumes:
      my-volume:
    networks:
      my-network:
```

Note that while `compose` services also get the same Lando *secret sauce* but there is a notable difference here. By default Lando will hijack the Docker containers `entrypoint`. This means if your custom container set's its own entrypoint you will need to remove that entrypoint and set it as the first argument in the `command`.

In the example above `docker-php-entrypoint` is the default `entrypoint` for the `drupal:8` image but we have moved it so that it is the first argument of `command`. This both allows the container to run as expected and allows Lando to do its thing.
