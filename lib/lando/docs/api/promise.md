## lando.Promise()
Extends [bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html)
so that our promises have some retry functionality.

All functionality should be the same as bluebird except where indicated
below

Note that bluebird currently wants you to use scoped prototypes to extend
it rather than the normal extend syntax so that is why this is using the "old"
way

**Kind**: global function
