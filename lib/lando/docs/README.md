## Join the Alliance

Lando is and always will be _**free**_ and _**open source**_.

That said, it takes a considerable amount of time to maintain, support and grow Lando. If you like Lando and think it's valuable we'd _highly encourage_ you to [join _The Lando Alliance_](https://lando.dev/memberships/) and return some of that value to help support our movement to liberate developers everywhere.

We're down to keep solving DevOps for everyone and with your support we can.
