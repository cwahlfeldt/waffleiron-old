</header>
<div class="entry-content row"><section class="col-8">Thomas-Mamer.com websites (collectively “Thomas-Mamer.com” in this document) refer to sites hosted on the Thomas-Mamer.com, WordPress.net, WordCamp.org, BuddyPress.org, bbPress.org, and other related domains and subdomains thereof. This privacy policy describes how Thomas-Mamer.com uses and protects any information that you give us. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. If you provide us with personal information through Thomas-Mamer.com, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
Like most website operators, Thomas-Mamer.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Thomas-Mamer.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Thomas-Mamer.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Thomas-Mamer.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Thomas-Mamer.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Thomas-Mamer.com does not use IP addresses to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
Certain visitors to Thomas-Mamer.com choose to interact with Thomas-Mamer.com in ways that require Thomas-Mamer.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Thomas-Mamer.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and email address.

In each case, Thomas-Mamer.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Thomas-Mamer.com. Thomas-Mamer.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities, like purchasing a WordCamp ticket.

All of the information that is collected on Thomas-Mamer.com will be handled in accordance with GDPR legislation.
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
Thomas-Mamer.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Thomas-Mamer.com’s behalf or to provide services available through Thomas-Mamer.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Thomas-Mamer.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

Thomas-Mamer.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to project administrators, employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Thomas-Mamer.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, if you give permission to have your information shared, or when Thomas-Mamer.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Thomas-Mamer.com, third parties, or the public at large.

If you are a registered user of a Thomas-Mamer.com website and have supplied your email address, Thomas-Mamer.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Thomas-Mamer.com and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Thomas-Mamer.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
<h3>Use of personal information</h3>
We use the information you provide to register for an account, attend our events, receive newsletters, use certain other services, or participate in the WordPress open source project in any other way.

We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.

We would like to send you email marketing communication which may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have consented to marketing, you may opt out later.

You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.
<h3>Legal grounds for processing personal information</h3>
We rely on one or more of the following processing conditions:

 	<li>explicit consent that you have given;</li>
 	<li>legal obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Access to data</h3>
You have the right to request a copy of the information we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all your personal information, please follow the instructions at the end of this section.

<h3>Retention of personal information</h3>
We will retain your personal information on our systems only for as long as we need to, for the success of the WordPress open source project and the programs that support Thomas-Mamer.com. We keep contact information (such as mailing list information) until a user unsubscribes or requests that we delete that information from our live systems. If you choose to unsubscribe from a mailing list, we may keep certain limited information about you so that we may honor your request.

Thomas-Mamer.com will not delete personal data from logs or records necessary to the operation, development, or archives of the WordPress open source project.

Thomas-Mamer.com shall maintain WordCamp attendee data for 3 years to better track and foster community growth, and then automatically delete non-essential data collected via registration. Attendee names and email addresses will be retained indefinitely, to preserve our ability to respond to code of conduct reports.

On WordCamp.org sites, banking/financial data collected as part of a reimbursement request is deleted from WordCamp.org 7 days after the request is marked paid. The reason for the 7-day retention period is to prevent organizers having to re-enter their banking details if a wire fails or if a payment was marked “Paid” in error. Invoices and receipts related to WordCamp expenses are retained for 7 years after the close of the calendar year’s audit, by instruction of our financial consultants (auditors &amp; bookkeepers).

When deletion is requested or otherwise required, we will anonymise the data of data subjects and/or remove their information from publicly accessible sites if the deletion of data would break essential systems or damage the logs or records necessary to the operation, development, or archival records of the WordPress open source project.

If you would like to request deletion of your account and associated data, please follow these steps:
<ol>
 	<li>Visit <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/data-erasure-request/">https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/data-erasure-request/</a>.</li>
 	<li>Enter your email address.</li>
 	<li>Click “Accept Declaration and Request Permanent Account Deletion”.</li>
</ol>
Note: If you have a WP.org account, it’s recommended you log in before submitting to associate your account with the request.
