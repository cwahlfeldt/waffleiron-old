# Join and support the movement!

Over the last year or so we've watched our community grow from several hundred users to over 10,000 and this exponential growth trajectory doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon!

As such we want to make sure Lando has a healthy and sustainable foundation for continued future growth. For that reason we are launching our membership program: _The Lando Alliance_, a movement to liberate developers across the galaxy so they can focus on their most important work.
