# Tomcat

[Tomcat](https://tomcat.tomcat.org/) The Apache TomcatÂ® software is an open source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies.

You can easily add it to your Lando app by adding an entry to the [services](./../config/services.md) top-level config in your [Landofile](./../config/lando.md).

*   [9](https://hub.docker.com/_/tomcat/)

## Legacy versions

You can still run these versions with Lando but for all intents and purposes they should be considered deprecated eg YMMV and do not expect a ton of support if you have an issue.

## Patch versions

::: warning Not officially supported!
While we allow users to specify patch versions for this service they are not *officially* supported so if you use one YMMV.
:::

To use a patch version you can do something like this:

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    type: tomcat:7.0.91
```

But make sure you use one of the available [patch tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/tomcat/tags/) for the underlying image we are using.

## Configuration

Here are the configuration options, set to the default values, for this service. If you are unsure about where this goes or what this means we *highly recommend* scanning the [services documentation](./../config/services.md) to get a good handle on how the magicks work.

Also note that the below options are in addition to the [build steps](./../config/services.md#build-steps) and [overrides](./../config/services.md#overrides) that are available to every service.

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    type: tomcat:8
    webroot: .
    ssl: false
    config:
      server: SEE BELOW
      web: SEE BELOW
      context: SEE BELOW
      users: SEE BELOW
```

### Using custom Tomcat config files

You may need to override our [default tomcat config](https://github.com/lando/lando/tree/master/plugins/lando-services/services/tomcat) with your own.

If you do this you must use files that exists inside your applicaton and express them relative to your project root as below.

Note that the default files may change based on how you set `ssl`.

**A hypothetical project**

Note that you can put your configuration files anywhere inside your application directory. We use a `config` directory in the below example but you can call it whatever you want such as `.lando`.

```bash
./
|-- config
   |-- server.xml
   |-- web.xml
   |-- context.xml
   |-- tomcat-users.xml
|-- index.html
|-- .lando.yml
```

**Landofile using custom tomcat config**

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    type: tomcat
    config:
      server: config/server.xml
      web: config/web.xml
      context: config/context.xml
      users: config/tomcat-users.xml
```
