    iron can build an app that uses the same data as your site but this is more for special features than anything else at this point<br>
    <pre>
      # use iron for building assets and allow the app
      # to use the exact same theme and classes
      $ iron build

      # OR local server
      $ iron start

      # OR for production
      $ iron deploy
    </pre>
  </p>
